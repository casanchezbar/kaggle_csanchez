# Projects 
- [CycleGAN](https://github.com/casanchezbar/kaggle_csanchez/blob/main/cyclegan/cyclegan-in-pytorch.ipynb): This project focuses on tranfering the Monet paiting style to images. The model is implemented in PyTorch, following a CycleGAN architecture.

- [Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/casanchezbar/kaggle_csanchez/blob/main/disaster-tweets/disaster-tweets-with-nlp-and-pytorch.ipynb): An NLP problem implemented in PyTorch to validate whether a tweet is a real disaster notification.

- [Cancer Detection](https://github.com/casanchezbar/kaggle_csanchez/blob/main/histopathologic_cancer_detection/cancer-detection-using-cnn-and-pytorch.ipynb): Performs binary classification on digital pathology scans of lymph node section images using CNNs and PyTorch.

- [Retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) diseases classification](https://github.com/casanchezbar/kaggle_csanchez/blob/main/retinal_oct/retinaloct-with-pytorch.ipynb): Diagnoses retinal OCT images using CNNs and PyTorch.

- [Water Pollution Analysis](https://github.com/casanchezbar/kaggle_csanchez/blob/main/water_pollution_analysis/impactwaterpollution.ipynb): Explores the relationship between water quality indicators and the prevalence of waterborne diseases (such as diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid) as a regression problem.
