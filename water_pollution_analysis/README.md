# Analyzing the Impact of Water Pollution on Waterborne Disease Prevalence


This project explores the relationship between water quality indicators and the prevalence of waterborne diseases (such as diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid) across countries and regions from 2000 to 2025. By leveraging the "Water Pollution and Disease" dataset, the analysis aims to identify patterns and correlations between contaminant levels, access to clean water, sanitation coverage, and public health outcomes. The project utilizes statistical analysis and data visualization to uncover key drivers of disease outbreaks and inform potential interventions.

## Problem Statement
The core problem addressed is understanding how environmental water quality factors contribute to the incidence of waterborne diseases globally.

- Which water quality parameters (e.g., contaminant level, bacteria count, turbidity) are most strongly associated with disease outbreaks?
- How do socioeconomic and infrastructural factors (e.g., sanitation coverage, healthcare access, GDP per capita) modulate these relationships?

### Type of problem
- Primarily exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical correlation.
- The dataset is also suitable for supervised machine learning tasks, such as regression or classification, to predict disease incidence based on water and socioeconomic features
